\subsection{The Optimisation Problem}
\label{sec:model}
\noindent Previous agent-based models for team coordination in disaster response typically assume deterministic task executions and environments \cite{ramchurn:etal:2010,Scerri2005}. However, in order to evaluate agent-guided coordination in a real-world environment, it is important to consider uncertainties due to player behaviours and the environment (as discussed in the previous section). Given this, we propose a new representation for the task allocation problem in disaster response that does take into account such uncertainties. More specifically, we represent this problem using an MMDP that captures the uncertainties of the radioactive cloud and the responders' behaviours. We model the spreading of the radioactive cloud as a random process over the disaster space and allow the actions requested from the responders to  fail (because they decline to go to a  task) or incur delays (because they are too slow) during the rescue process. Thus in the MMDP model, we represent  task executions as stochastic processes of state transitions, while the uncertainties of the radioactive cloud and the responders' behaviours can be easily captured with transition probabilities.  More formally, the MMDP is
represented by tuple $\mathcal{M} = \langle I, S, \{A_i\}, P, R
\rangle$, where $I$ is the set of actors as defined in the previous
section,  $S$ is the state space, $A_i$ is a set of responder
$p_i$'s actions, $P$ is the transition function, and $R$ is the
reward function. We elaborate on each of these below.

In more detail, $S= S^G_r \times S_{p_1} \times \cdots \times
S_{p_n} \times S_{t_1} \times \cdots \times S_{t_m}$ where $S^G_r =
\{l_{(x,y)}| (x, y) \in G\}$ is the state variable of the
radioactive cloud that specifies the radioactive level
$l_{(x,y)}\in[0, 100]$ at every point $(x, y)\in G$. $S_{p_i} =
\langle h_i, (x_i, y_i), t_j \rangle$ is the state variable for
each responder $p_i$ that specifies her health level
$h_i\in[0, 100]$, her present position $(x_i, y_i)$, and the task
$t_j$ she is carrying out. $S_{t_j} = \langle {\tt st_j}, (x_j, y_j)
\rangle$ is then the state variable for task $t_j$ to specify its
status ${\tt st_j}$ (i.e., the target is picked up, dropped off, or idle) and position $(x_j, y_j)$. 

The three types of actions  (in set $A_i$) a responder can take
are: (i) {\em stay} in the current location $(x_i, y_i)$, (ii) {\em
move} to the 8 neighbouring locations, or (iii) {\em complete} a
task located at $(x_i, y_i)$. A joint action $\vec{a}=\langle a_1,
\cdots, a_n \rangle$ is a set of actions where $a_i\in A_i$, one
for each responder (a responder may just \emph{stay} at its current
position if it has no targets to rescue). The transition function
$P$ is defined in more detail as: $P= P_r \times P_{p_1} \times
\cdots \times P_{p_n} \times P_{t_1} \times \cdots \times P_{t_m}$
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep=-2pt
    \item $P_r(s'_r|s_r)$ is the probability the radioactive
        cloud spreads from state $s_r\in S^G_r$ to $s'_r\in
        S^G_r$. It captures the uncertainty of the  radiation
        levels in the environment due to  noisy sensor readings
        and the variations in wind speed and direction.
    \item $P_{p_i}(s'_{p_i}|s, a_i)$ is the probability
        responder $p_i$ transitions to a new state $s'_{p_i}\in
        S_{p_i}$ when executing action $a_i$. For example, when
        a responder is asked to go to a new location,  she
        may not end up there because  she is tired,
        gets injured, or receives radiation doses that are life
        threatening.
    \item $P_{t_j}(s'_{t_j}|s, \vec{a})$ is the probability
        of task $t_j$ being completed. A task $t_j$ can only be completed by a
        team of responders with the required types ($\Theta_{t_j}$) located at the
        same position as $t_j$.
\end{itemize}

Now,  if  $t_j$ is completed (i.e., in ${\tt st_j}\in S_{t_j}$, the
status ${\tt st_j}$ is marked as ``dropped off'' and its position $(x_j,
y_j)$ is within a safe zone), the team will be rewarded using
function $R$. The team is penalised if a responder $p_i$ gets
injured or receives a high dose of radiation (i.e., in $s_{p_i}$,
the health level $h_i$ is 0). Moreover, we attribute a cost to each
of the responders' actions since  each  action requires them to
exert some effort (e.g., running or carrying objects).


Give the above definitions, a policy for the MMDP is a mapping from
states to joint actions, $\pi: S \rightarrow \vec{A}$ so that the
responders know which actions to take given the current state of
the problem. The quality of a policy $\pi$ is  measured by
its expected value $V^\pi$, which can be computed recursively by
the Bellman equation:
\begin{equation}
  V^\pi(s^\tau) = R(s^\tau, \pi(s^\tau)) + \!\!\!\sum_{s^{\tau+1}\in S}\!\!\!
  P(s^{\tau+1}|s^\tau, \pi(s^t)) V^\pi(s^{\tau+1})
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ denotes the current time point and $\pi(s^\tau)$ is a joint action given $s^\tau$. The goal of solving
the MMDP is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximises the
expected value with the initial state $s^0$, $\pi^* =
\arg\max_{\pi} V^\pi(s^0)$.

At each decision step, we assume the planning agent can fully
observe the state of the environment $s$ by collecting sensor
readings of the radioactive cloud and GPS locations of the
responders. Given a policy $\pi$ of the MMDP, a joint action
$\vec{a}=\pi(s)$ can be selected and broadcast to the responders
(as mentioned earlier).
