Key points:

Trust in systems - bradshaw

mistrust signatures - should be easy to spot
automation may be working as it should but should not be used - e.g., when agent does not understand player context
- interrogating the machine to establish basis for trust- e.g., check allocations but no visibility of worker performance
- how to simplify trust analysis? understand basics of allocation mechanism
- help operator ask the right questions about the operation of the system but also simplify these questions and answers

Scerri:

Transfer of control strategy - pre-defined sequence of actions to ensure human input is best used.
Prescriptions for how plans should be managed - this works for autonomous agents as the team enacting the plan but what about humans enacting the plan? Can they implement such rules and transfer of control strategies?
- based on STEAM - joint intentions
- not tested in reality
