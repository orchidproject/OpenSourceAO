\title{Human-Agent Collaboration for Real-World Disaster Response}
\author{Tracking No. 1505}

 \maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We develop an algorithm to assist with the task of coordinating emergency responders in uncertain environments and evaluate it in a novel mixed-reality game called AtomicOrchid. Specifically, the algorithm is used by a software  agent that works alongside a human commander to guide human players to complete rescue tasks. Moreover, we study the interactions between the human players and the agent in real-time and show that our algorithm improves  performance significantly (compared to a non-agent setting). Our results allow us to specify design guidelines for human-agent collaboration in such settings.
