%\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%\noindent In this paper developed and evaluated a task planning agent using a mixed-reality game  called AtomicOrchid in order to focus on the issues that arise in human-agent collaboration in team coordination under uncertainty. Results from our study indicate  the planning agent instructed players to carry out successful plans (outperforming a no-agent setting in terms of tasks completed and responders unharmed). Finally our results  suggest that systems involving human-agent collaboration should be adaptive, involve simple  interactions between humans and agents, and allow for flexible autonomy. 
%Future work will look at running AtomicOrchid with expert responders and  exploring different interactional arrangements of humans and agents, in particular where control may be distributed across the team.\vspace{-1mm}
