\section{The Field Trials}\label{sec:evaluation}
\noindent We ran three sessions of AtomicOrchid with participants recruited from the local university. We focus on situated reactions to agent instructions to explore how the interaction unfolded. The uncertainties of the field setting and small number of trials prohibit statistical analysis at this stage. Hence, we focus on descriptive results. 

%\subsection{Participants and Procedure}
%\noindent  
A total of 24 participants (13 males and 11 females) were recruited through posters and emails, and reimbursed with \pounds 15  for 1.5-2 hours of study. The majority were students. The procedure consisted of 30 minutes of game play, and about 1 hour in total of pre-game briefing, consent forms,  a short training session, and a post-game group discussion. 

%Upon arrival in the HQ (set up in a meeting room at the local university), participants were briefed and asked to consent to participate. They were presented with a demographic questionnaire to record gender, occupation, experience of using smartphones and level of map navigation skills.

At the end of the briefing, in which mission objectives and rules were outlined, responder types were randomly assigned to all participants (fire-fighter, medic, transporter, soldier). The HQ was staffed by a different member of the research team in each session in order to mimic an experienced $H$, while avoiding the same person running the HQ every time.  Moreover, responders were provided with a smartphone and $H$ with a laptop. The team was given 5 minutes to discuss a common game strategy.  First responders were then accompanied to the starting point within the designated game area, about 1 minute walk from $H$. After 30 minutes of game play the first responders returned to the HQ where the post-game group interview was conducted.

%\subsection{Game Sessions}
%\noindent 
We ran one session without $PA$, and two sessions with $PA$  to compare team performance in the two versions. Each session involved \emph{different} sets of players (8 each). Thus,  players were unique to a session to avoid learning effects between sessions. We also ran a pilot study for each condition to fine tune game configuration. The whole team was formed such that there were two of each of the four types of responders. The terrain of the 400$\times$400 metres  game area includes grassland, a lake, buildings, roads,  footpaths and lawns. There were two  drop-off zones and 16 targets in each session. There were four targets for each of the four target types. The target locations, pattern of cloud movement and expansion were kept constant for all game sessions. The pilot study showed that this was a challenging, yet not too overwhelming configuration of game area size, and number of targets to collect in a 30 min game session. 

\subsubsection{Data Collection and Analysis.}
\noindent 
We collected more than 4 hours of video and 10 pages of transcribed audio (from game action and at HQ). We then developed a log file replay tool to triangulate video recordings of game action with the timestamped system logs that contain a complete record of the game play, including responders' GPS location, their health status and radioactive exposure, messages, cloud location, locations of target objects and task status.

%Video recordings of field action were catalogued to identify sequences (episodes) of interest (cf. Heath et al., 2010). Key decision points in teaming and task allocation served to index the episodes. Interesting distinct units of interaction were transcribed and triangulated with log files of relevant game activity for deeper analysis. Due to space constraints we can only  present one fragment in this paper to illustrate how human-agent collaboration typically unfolded (TODO).
To assess how humans interact with each other and with $PA$, we focused on collecting data relevant to $PA$'s task allocations and remote messages  that are used to support coordination. In particular, we use speech-act theory \cite{searle:1975} to classify messages sent between and among responders and $H$. We focus on the most relevant types of acts in this paper (which are also the most frequently used):
\begin{itemize}
\item Assertives: \textit{speech acts that commit a speaker to the truth of the expressed proposition}; these were a common category as they include messages that contain situational information.
\item Directives: \textit{speech acts that are meant to cause the hearer to take a particular action}, e.g. requests, commands and advice, including task and team allocation messages. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results.}
\noindent Overall, 8 targets were rescued in the non-agent condition (Session A), and respectively 12 targets (Session B) and 11 targets (Session C) were rescued in the agent condition. Teams (re-)formed six times in session A, four times in session B and nine times  in session C. Average player health after the game was much higher (more than double) for the agent-assisted sessions (80 for Session B and 82 for Session C) compared to the session without agent (40 in Session A). In fact, one responder `died' in Session A.
$PA$ dynamically re-planned 14 times in session B and 18 times in session C. This was mainly triggered by a dropped off (completed) target (24 times), but sometimes this was triggered by a player declining the agent's task allocation (8 times).

%Table \ref{tab:msgs} shows the remote message directives (mainly related to task allocation and execution) and assertives (mainly related to situational awareness) sent in the sessions. 
In what follows, we explicate how the different types of messages (Table \ref{tab:msgs}) were handled to give a sense of mixed-initiative coordination in the sessions.


%\subsubsection{Handling Task Allocations}
In the non-agent condition, $H$ sent 43 task allocation directives (see Figure \ref{fig:msgs}). The field responders brought up only 15 out of these messages in conversation. Out of these 15, responders chose to ignore the instructions only once because they were engaged in another task that they did not want to abandon. A further 4 $H$ instructions were consistent with a decision to rescue a certain target that had already been agreed locally by the responders. In the remaining 10 cases, first responders chose to follow the instructions. Although players were willing to follow $H$'s instructions, they failed to correctly follow the instructions due to confusion and misunderstanding in the communication. In fact, only 2 instances of directives from $H$ led to task completion. The first responders performed 6 rescue operations (tasks) without being instructed by $H$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics{message_handling.png}
\caption{Message handling by first responders in  agent (left), and non-agent (right) versions.}\label{fig:msgs}
\end{figure}

In contrast, when task allocation was handled by the agent (52 tasks allocated in session B and C), responders explicitly accepted 24 tasks,  of which they completed 15  successfully. Although there was either no response or no consensus between the responders (in 17 tasks allocated), they still completed 6 of these tasks successfully. In total, 20 task allocations were withdrawn by the agent as a result of re-planning. 

%\paragraph{Rejecting task allocations}
In terms of task rejections, first responders rejected $PA$'s task allocation 11 times in the agent version. All of the rejections happened when following the allocation would have \emph{split existing teams}, or instructed responders to team up with \emph{physically more distant responders}. In most cases (9 out of 11), the rejection \emph{adjusted the agent's task allocation} to become consistent with the responder's current team. In the other two cases, the responders rejected the task allocation one more time before receiving the desired task allocation. Notably, for accepted instructions the average distance between suggested teammates was 12 metres. For rejected instructions the average was 86 metres.

The results above show that  the simple mechanism to get $PA$ to re-plan (i.e., reject/accept) was more successful (more tasks completed and less confusion) than the open-ended interactions between $H$ and the responders.  Moreover, the fact that many of the rejections coincided with larger distances to suggested teammates implies that players chose to do the tasks they \emph{preferred} rather than those deemed optimal by the agent. This indicates there may be an issue of trust in the agent, but also that it may be easier for a responder to impose such preferences on an agent (and indirectly to other team members) rather than expressing this to $H$ or directly to teammates. 

% Role of HQ commander
Furthermore, in the agent-assisted setting, $H$ frequently \emph{monitored} the allocation of tasks  returned by the agent (57 clicks on `show task' in UI responder status widget). Whereas 43 directives (out of 89) in the non-agent session were task allocations, in the agent version only 16 out of 68 were directly related to task allocations. Out of these, $H$ directly reinforced the agent's instruction 6 times (e.g., ``SS and LT retrieve 09''), and complemented (i.e., added to or elaborated) $PA$'s task allocation 5 times (e.g., ``DP and SS, as soon as you can head to 20 before the radiation cloud gets there first''). $H$  did `override' $PA$'s instruction in 5 cases.  

In the agent version, most of $H$'s directives (52 out of 68) and assertives (49 out of 50) focussed on \textit{providing situational awareness and routing} the responders to avoid exposing them to radiation. For example, ``NK and JL approach drop off 6 by navigating via 10 and 09.'', or ``Radiation cloud is at the east of the National College''. 

\subsection{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:discussion}
In summary, the results from our field trials suggest three key observations with regard to  human-agent coordination: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item First responders performed better (rescued more targets)  and maintained higher health levels when supported by the agent.  These results echo those obtained under simulation (shown earlier) and  may reflect the better forward-planning capability of the planning agent compared to human responders and HQ. 
 
\item Rejecting tasks was relatively frequently employed to trigger re-planning to obtain new task allocations aligned with responder preferences.  In each case, the planning agent was able to adapt to provide an alternative  that was acceptable to the responders. Without this facility we believe the responders would have chosen to ignore the plan. Task rejection seemed to be linked to changes to established teams, especially when members were relatively distant. Consequently, these kinds of allocations may need particular support (e.g., explanation) or might be less preferentially selected by $PA$.

\item When task allocation was handled by $PA$, $H$ could focus on providing vital situational awareness to safely route first responders around danger zones: thus demonstrating effective division of labour and complementary collaboration between humans and agents.
\end{enumerate}

Given these observations we argue that a planning agent for team formation should not only model the uncertainty in player behaviours and in the environment, but that interactional challenges also need to be addressed  if such a technology is to be accepted in practice. In particular, if such a system were to be deployed with expert responders, we foresee the need to ensure the agent's recommendations come with proper explanations in order to be trusted and further augment their capability. In particular, we propose the following \textit{design guidelines for human-agent collaboration}:

\noindent \textbf{Adaptivity}:  planning algorithms should be designed to take in human input, and more importantly, be \emph{responsive} to the needs of the users. Players repeatedly requested new tasks and this would not have been possible unless our algorithm  was computationally efficient  and could  assimilate updates, requests, and constraints dynamically. 

\noindent \textbf{Interaction Simplicity}:  agents should be designed with minimal options to simplify the reasoning needed to interact with them, particularly when responders are under pressure to act. $PA$ was designed to issue simple commands (Do X with Y) and respond to simple requests (OK or Reject Task). These were better at guiding players to do the right task than the unstructured human communication (fraught with inconsistencies and inaccuracies) in the non-agent version. 

\noindent \textbf{Flexbile autonomy}: interfaces should be designed to pass control between humans and agents in flexible ways. The HQ dashboard allowed $H$ to \emph{check} and \emph{correct for} the allocations of $PA$, taking into account the real-world constraints that the players on the ground faced. In particular, letting the human oversee the agent (i.e., ``on-the-loop") at times and actively instructing  the players (and bypassing the agent) at other times (i.e., ``in-the-loop") as and when needed, was seen to be particularly effective. In contrast to \cite{scerri:etal:2005} which advocated pre-scripted transfers of control, in our case  control was transferred between $H$ and $PA$ depending on the context and, at times, in unforeseen ways.

To further refine these guidelines, future work will look at running AtomicOrchid with expert responders and explore different interactional arrangements of humans and agents, in particular where control is distributed across the team.\vspace{-1mm}
